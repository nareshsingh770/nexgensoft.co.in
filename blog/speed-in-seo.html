    <p>
      A fast-loading website not only enhances user experience but also plays a major role in improving your Google rankings. 
      Search engines prioritize performance because users expect websites to load instantly.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Speed Matters for SEO</h2>
    <p>
      Google’s algorithm uses page loading time as a ranking factor. 
      Websites that load within 2 seconds tend to have higher retention and lower bounce rates.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Improve Website Speed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Optimize and compress images.</li>
      <li>Use caching and a CDN (Content Delivery Network).</li>
      <li>Minify CSS and JavaScript files.</li>
      <li>Reduce HTTP requests.</li>
      <li>Choose a fast hosting provider.</li>
